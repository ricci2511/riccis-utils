# riccis-utils
Collection of utilities, little programs and scripts that I mostly use for my homelab.

- [filecollate](https://github.com/ricci2511/filecollate): Tiny `go` package for concurrent file grouping with customizable collation criteria. 
- [deduplo](https://github.com/ricci2511/deduplo): CLI tool for identifying and optionally deleting duplicates (powered by `filecollate`).
- [audio_transcode](https://github.com/ricci2511/audio_transcode): Shell script for transcoding audio in video files to AC3 format with customizable settings (supports [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr) and [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr) events).
